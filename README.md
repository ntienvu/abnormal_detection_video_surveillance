### Run the code
The data has been preprocessed for background subtraction. (see script script_extract_feature.m).
In the paper, we use Bayesian Nonparametric Factor Analysis which identifies K=40 hidden patterns from the data. However the posterior inference is slow. Thus, here we use the built-in function nnmf from Matlab for optimizing speed.
